        Bug found on lines 94-100.

        The ELSE block starting on line 95 was assigned to the IF starting
        on 85 instead of the IF block starting on line 86. This meant that
        if the user entered at the login screen exists no password would
        be checked.

        It was doing this:

        If session has current user who has an ID
            If password has already been validated
                SUCCESS
            Else
                Return to autohandler with valid session & implicit auth
        Else delete session

    
        This has now been corrected to this:

        If session has current user who has an ID
            If password has already been validated
                SUCCESS
            Else
                Delete session
        Else return to autohandler with whatever we had before the block

        Bug #1 found on line 446. 

        CanonicalizeUserInfo was being called directly, instead of being 
        called on the $self user object.
        
        This was causing CanonicalizeUserInfo to shift the e-mail address 
        it was passed into the $self var instead of the $email var. It was
        therefore returning a blank e-mail address regardless of the input.

        Header comments altered to reflect that the file is part of the
        RT::Authen::ExternalAuth extension.
