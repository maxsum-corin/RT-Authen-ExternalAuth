RT-Authen-ExternalAuth

This module provides the ability to authenticate RT users
against one or more external data sources at once. It will
also allow information about that user to be loaded from
the same, or any other available, source.

The extension currently supports authentication and 
information from LDAP via the Net::LDAP module, and from
any data source that an installed DBI driver is available
for. 

It was originally designed and tested against: 

MySQL v4.1.21-standard
MySQL v5.0.22
Windows Active Directory v2003

But it has been designed so that it should work with ANY
LDAP service and ANY DBI-drivable database, based upon the
configuration given in your $RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Once installed, you should view the file:
    
    $RTHOME/local/etc/ExternalAuth/RT_SiteConfig.pm

Then use the examples provided to prepare your own custom 
configuration which should reside in 
$RTHOME/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm

Alternatively, you may alter the provided examples directly
and then include the extra directives by including the
example file's path at the end of your RT_SiteConfig.pm
